# Scientific Calculator

This is a simple scientific calculator built using Python and Tkinter. It supports basic arithmetic operations, exponentiation, square root, trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, and more.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

## Usage

To run the calculator, simply run the `calculator.py` file:

```commandline
python calculator.py
```

The calculator interface should appear on the screen.

To perform a calculation, enter a mathematical expression using the calculator buttons or your keyboard. Press the `=` button or the `Enter` key to calculate the result. If the expression is invalid or cannot be calculated, the calculator will display an error message.

To clear the calculator input, press the `C` button or the `Escape` key.

## Features

The calculator supports the following operations and functions:

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Exponentiation (`^`)
- Square root (`sqrt`)
- Logarithm (base 10) (`log`)
- Natural logarithm (`ln`)
- Trigonometric functions: sine (`sin`), cosine (`cos`), tangent (`tan`), arc-sine (`asin`), arc-cosine (`acos`), arc-tangent (`atan`)
- Angle conversion: degrees (`deg`), radians (`rad`)
- Modulo (`%`)
- Factorial (`!`)
